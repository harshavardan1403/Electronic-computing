# ESP32 Ultrasonic Sensor Project

Welcome to the ESP32 Ultrasonic Sensor project repository! This repository contains the source code and related files for a simple embedded systems project that uses an ESP32 microcontroller board and an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects or individuals. When an object or individual gets too close, the system activates a red LED light and a buzzer to indicate closeness.

## Project Overview

- **Platform:** Wowki Simulation Platform
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32
- **Sensor:** Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- **Output:** Red LED , RGB LED and Buzzer

This project is a basic example of how to use an ESP32 microcontroller to create a simple proximity detection system using an ultrasonic sensor. The red LED and buzzer are activated when an object is detected within a certain range, and both turn off when the object moves away.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-ultrasonic-sensor-project.git
   cd esp32-ultrasonic-sensor-project
   ```

2. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the ESP32 as per the schematic provided in the `schematics/` folder.
   - Ensure that the red LED and buzzer are also connected to the ESP32 as per the schematic.

3. **Software Setup:**
   - Open the `main.ino` file in the Arduino IDE (or your preferred IDE for ESP32 development).
   - Install any necessary libraries or board support if not already installed.
   - Upload the sketch to your ESP32.

4. **Usage:**
   - Power on your ESP32.
   - The system will detect nearby objects using the ultrasonic sensor.
   - When an object gets too close, the red LED will light up, and the buzzer will buzz to indicate closeness.
   - The LED and buzzer will turn off when the object moves away.

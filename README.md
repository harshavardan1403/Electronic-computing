## Introduction

Embedded systems play a crucial role in the modern world, powering everything from IoT devices to consumer electronics. This repository is a place for you to share your mini embedded projects, ranging from simple LED blinkers to more complex IoT applications. The goal is to create a resource for fellow enthusiasts, learners, and hobbyists who are interested in embedded systems and microcontrollers.

## Project Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
mini-embedded-projects/
  â”œâ”€â”€ project-1/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schematics/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ project-2/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schematics/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
  â”œâ”€â”€ ...
  â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
```

- `project-x/`: Each project gets its own directory. You can organize your project in the way that makes the most sense to you, including documentation, code, and schematics.
- `code/`: This directory should contain all the source code, firmware, or software relevant to the project.
- `schematics/`: If your project involves any hardware components, upload schematics and hardware design files in this folder.
- `README.md`: Each project directory should have a README file that explains what the project does, how to set it up, and any other relevant information.
